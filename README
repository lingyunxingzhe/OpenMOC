OpenMOC: An Open-Source Method of Characteristics Code

Mantainers
  FIXME: Add a list of each module and the module's mantainer here.

Coding Conventions
  Class Naming Convention
    a) Each class will be camelcase beginning with an uppercase letter (ie,
       MyClassName)
    b) All classes will be placed in their own header and source files (ie,
       MyClassName.h and MyClassName.cpp)
    c) Class member attributes will start with an underscore and will be all
       lowercase with underscores separating words (ie, _my_class_attribute)
    d) Class methods will be camelcase starting with a lowercase letter (ie,
       myClassMethod(....))
  File Naming Convention
    a) Files which define classes will begin with an uppercase letter and will
       have the same name as the class they define (ie, MyClassName.h and
       MyClassName.h).
    b) Files with helper functions will be in all lowercase letters (ie,
       myhelperfunctions.h and myhelperfunctions.cpp)
